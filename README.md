Racitve.JS - The missing manual

This book is being built on PenFlip and will be mirrored here as more and more is written.
Everything is written in Markdown (duh!) so compiling should be straight forward.

If you would like to make changes please submit a pull request, I'd really appreciate and would love to put your name in the book.

If you'd like a topic covered or want to see how something is done then create an issue and I'll respond as soon as I can.
