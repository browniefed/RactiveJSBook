# Introduction

The rise of JavaScript libraries has been on the rise in the past few years. This can be demonstrated by looking at all the examples at [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). Each one has their pros and cons and some have become more popular than others. Some of the more popular ones are Angular, Ember, React, BackBone, and Knockout just to name a few. Ractive draws a lot of inspiration from Angular, so much so that it used to be called Anglebars. It is also draws similarties between Knockout as Knockout was one of the first libraries with declarative binding.

I will not go into a full indepth background and innerworkings of Ractive as it has been already documented well on the [Ractive Blog](http://blog.ractivejs.org/). Including the [origins of Ractive](http://blog.ractivejs.org/posts/the-origins-of-ractive), how Ractive follows the newest [trend of reactive programming](http://blog.ractivejs.org/posts/ractive-js-expressions-and-the-new-wave-of-reactive-programming), and how it [differs/relates to Angular](http://blog.ractivejs.org/posts/whats-the-difference-between-angular-and-ractive)
