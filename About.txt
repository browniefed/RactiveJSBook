### About
I always hate the about section and generally skim over it so I'll keep this short and sweet.
My name is Jason Brown, I am a front end developer at Jama Software a Portland, Oregon based company. We build product delivery software and are looking to be pioneers in the industry. We want to help our customers be better, faster, and more productive over their competition. Ractive helps us iterate, test, and develop quickly. I write JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on a daily basis. I'm not a great writer but looking to get better.
If you notice anything wrong, not clear, or something that could be done better just let me know!
